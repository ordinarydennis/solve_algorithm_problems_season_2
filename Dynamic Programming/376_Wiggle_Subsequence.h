class Solution {
public:
	int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {




	}
};

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]
Output : 6
Explanation : The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences(6, -3, 5, -7, 3).
Example 2 :

	Input : nums = [1, 17, 5, 10, 13, 15, 10, 5, 16, 8]
	Output : 7
	Explanation : There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
	One is[1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences(16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).
	Example 3 :

	Input : nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
	Output : 2


	Constraints :

	1 <= nums.length <= 1000
	0 <= nums[i] <= 1000
